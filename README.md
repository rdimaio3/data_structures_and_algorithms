#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  The projects for this course tasked us with implementing a program for a university that would allow us to enter the ID number, title, and prerequisites for various computer science courses offered. This program was also intended to be able to sort the courses by number alphanumerically, print a list of all courses, and search for and print the information for a specific course.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

  The project was broken down into manageable tasks each week, mostly focusing on pseudocode. This allowed us to come up with sound logic for how the program would work well before doing any actual coding. This gave us a chance to try out the various data structures we learned about within the course. Each data structure has its own positives and negatives and doing it this way allowed us to explore all of them and decide which one was right for the task. For example, the main positive of a hash table is its encryption and privacy, which was not applicable in this case. In contrast, a binary search tree's advantage is ease and speed of searching for a course, which was something the program would be doing frequently in practice, which made it a better data structure for this task.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

  I've always found taking a break to be very helpful for me in many different problems, especially in this class. Stepping away when I was stuck and coming back to it would sometimes make the solution strangely obvious to me, causing me to wonder why I was even struggling in the first place. Of course, this will not always work and some problems are more complex than just needing a "fresh set of eyes". I utilized Youtube and the SNHU CS Discord extensively as well. Crowdsourcing knowledge is an incredibly effective way to find solutions to academic problems.

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

  Prior to this course, the only data structures I had really used were basic arrays, vectors, and linked lists. This course taught me about more advanced data structures such as hash tables and binary search trees. This course also delved deeper into time and space complexity, something only briefly touched on in previous classes. This cemented these concepts and gave me more confidence in considering runtime and using big O notation for future projects.
  
#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  This class allowed me to reuse code from previous assignments with some minor tweaks. This promotes the idea of adaptable code and allows me to see the power and utility of it. Once I have the fundamentals down for various concepts (such as the various data structures) it becomes clear that the same ideas and even the same code (classes, functions, methods, etc) stays largely the same even if performing different seeming tasks. I also focused on commenting my code and utilizing standard naming conventions, which contributes to maintainability and readability.
